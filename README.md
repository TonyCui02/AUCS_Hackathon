# Find my room 
(This branch contains the prototype app being rebuilt using react for better cross platform visualisation)
This is the depository for Find my room, a project created during the WDCC and Auckland University Compsci society hackathon

Our program uses 3-D visualisation to help students find their way to their next university room.
